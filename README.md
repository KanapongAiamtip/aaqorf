## language of development. :balloon: :balloon: :balloon:
- [Python](https://www.python.org) for building our frontend HTML application
- [HTML](https://html.com) for creating frontend application.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) for styling our application.
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)  for styling our application.

### RRCBWPA Necessary packages. :gem:
- [Open CV](https://opencv.org/) OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. Being an Apache 2 licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code.
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) There is also a more detailed Tutorial that shows how to create a small but complete application with Flask. Common patterns are described in the Patterns for Flask section. The rest of the docs describe each component of Flask in detail, with a full reference in the API section.
- [numpy](https://numpy.org) NumPy is an open source project that enables numerical computing with Python. It was created in 2005 building on the early work of the Numeric and Numarray libraries. NumPy will always be 100% open source software and free for all to use. It is released under the liberal terms of the modified BSD license.
- [ply](https://pillow.readthedocs.io) PIL is the Python Imaging Library
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) Tensorflow TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks.

## Prequistics. :bulb:
### Check the required versions. :pushpin: :pushpin: :pushpin:

  ```
  into the terminal.

## Running the application. :mag_right:
- Install.
  python dependencies in the project. Then open terminals and run these commands from the root of the project.
  - pip install numpy
  - pip install opencv-python
  - pip install tensorflow
  - pip install Flask
  ```
 - Running
  ```
  python app.py
